    <p class="Java_4">
        The total bill is 12,000 and there are 4 friends. 
        So, each person should pay 3,000. 
    </p>

    <script>

        let total_bill = 12000
        let John = 1
        let Mary = 1
        let Peter = 1
        let Basit = 1
        let total_persons = John + Mary + Peter + Basit
        let total_bill_per_person = total_bill / total_persons
        console.log(total_bill_per_person);
